We had an initial, virtual gathering of the community at CHI'22 in a SIG format. We focused on mapping who is the data+design community and what is the terminology We went through a series of interactive activies to find out who was attending, the qualitative and quantitative data in use and in which design process.

We collectivelly created the following [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO9kAiYw=/?share_link_id=550392868085). Feel free to have a look and add your contribution on the map.
