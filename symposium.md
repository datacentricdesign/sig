title: Data-Centric Design Symposium
---

We invite you to the first Data-Centric Design Symposium on Data as Human-Centred Design material. The symposium will be held on **December 7, 2023, at [X, on TU Delft campus](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/x/) and Online**.

[Free registration via Evenbrite]() | [Call for Participation](https://datacentricdesign.org/symposium/#call-for-participation) | [Program](https://datacentricdesign.org/symposium#program)


You'll be able to join fellow human-centred researchers and practitioners to map perspectives and experiences on designing with data. **Data-Centric Design** leverages data as material for subjective inquiry, an entry point to better understand human dynamics through deeper reflection in a research or design process. In this context, data presents unique opportunities and challenges; practices have yet to emerge to understand how they transform the role and processes of researchers.

Scientists and practitioners from multiple disciplines will gather in Delft and online, building on the CHI Special Interest Group ['22](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3491101.3516403) and ['23](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544549.3583180) on Data as Human-Centred Design Material and the international workshops and conversations gravitating around the topic. Nurturing the community, this community event aims at generating feedback and inspiration ahead of the call for papers for [Frontiers' Research Topic on Data-Centric Design](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/58823/data-centric-design-data-as-a-human-centred-material) on February 25, 2024.

The symposium will showcase local and international research from academia and industry engaging with data for subjective inquiry through a rich programme of talks and interactivities.

Whether you're an experienced human-centred data practitioner or new to the community, the first Data-Centric Design Symposium is the perfect place to gain new insights, make valuable connections, and expand your horizons. Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity to be a part of the conversation to shape the effective and responsible use of data in human-centred design processes!

This program was initiated by the Data-Centric Design Lab of TU Delft Industrial Design Engineering in collaboration with TU Eindhoven Industrial Design, Cardiff University School of Computer Science and Informatics, and TU Chemnitz Chair Media Informatics. Our main sponsors are Open Science Community Delft and Frontiers.

# Call for Participation

## Important dates
- Abstract submission: October 25 AoE
- Notification of acceptance: November 10 AoE
- Symposium: December 7

For this first Data-Centric Design Symposium, we want to gather perspectives from the community. We invite human-centred researchers to share their unique perspectives, knowledge, and experiences in designing with data.

Whether you are a doctoral researcher, faculty member, or practitioner, we believe your voice and expertise will enrich the symposium's discourse and help identify the opportunities and challenges in using data as material for subjective inquiry.

We welcome abstracts in the following areas
- Experience in using data as design material
- Collaboration around and through data
- Responsible data practices in design and research
- Tools and competencies for designing with data
- Data to foster creativity in the design process
- Participatory, co-creative and human-centred approach with data
- Data to foster creativity in the design process
- Expressive and tangible interaction with data
- Reflexive mechanisms to understand the impact of data on human behaviour
- Feminist Data Practices

**Selection Process**: We invite you to submit an abstract to the Frontiers Research Topics 'Data-Centric Design'. The guest editors (symposium organisers) will review your proposal, and acceptance notifications will be sent out by **November 10**. The acceptance of your abstract is an invitation to submit a full manuscript for peer review.

**At the symposium**: each accepted abstract contributor will have the opportunity to present their work and perspective in person or online.

**After the Symposium**: we will invite authors of all accepted contributions to extend their contribution into a full paper and submit their work to the Research Topic 'Data-Centric Design' of the Frontiers journal on 'Human Dynamics'. See the [open call for February 25, 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/58823/data-centric-design-data-as-a-human-centred-material).

**Submission Details**: please visit our [Research Topic webpage](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/58823/data-centric-design-data-as-a-human-centred-material) and complete the online submission form. The deadline for submissions is **October 25, 2023**.
