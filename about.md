## Goals

**1) Identify Best Practices:** How and where in the design process is data collected, applied and validated? What is a designerly take on collecting and using data through a process that is dynamic and iterative?  

**2) Co-Develop Appropriate Tools:** How to foster collaboration between designers and data scientists to create accessible, designer-friendly tools that enable a creative and  holistic engagement with data? What are the existing tools and methodologies that support designers in using data as creative design material?  

**3) Educate Stakeholders:** How to establish a common ground on responsibly setting up and running designerly, data-intensive projects with regulatory bodies? How to reduce the frictions that emerge from an exploratory, rather than an evaluative, approach to data-intensive activities?
